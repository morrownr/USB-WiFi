[1]: I have first hand experience with this adapter.
[2]: Excellent for 5 GHz AP mode (works well with a Raspberry Pi 4B)
[3]: Outstanding for 2.4 GHz AP mode
[4]: Use only for client (managed) mode. No AP mode. Limited monitor mode.
[5]: Wireless range is roughly estimated.

Criteria to make The Short List: 

1. Uses an In-kernel driver (adapter is plug and play).
2. Has either a documented track record or my own testing experience.
3. Is available to purchase as a new product.

USB WiFi adapters come in various shapes, sizes and speeds. Their capabilities
can vary greatly. The adapter that you pick needs to be chosen based on its
ability to do the job that you need it to do.
