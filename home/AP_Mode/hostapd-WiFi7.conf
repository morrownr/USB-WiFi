# /etc/hostapd/hostapd-WiFi7.conf
# Documentation: https://w1.fi/cgit/hostap/plain/hostapd/hostapd.conf

# 2025-11-08
# Purpose: example hostapd.conf for mt7925 based USB WiFi adapters and cards.
# Default: WiFi 7 on band 4 (6 GHz), 160 MHz channel width and WPA3.
# Status: beta testing, appears solid but needs continued testing.

# Tested driver: the mt7925u in-kernel driver (kernel 6.12) that is part of
# the mt76 series of drivers by Mediatek.

# Tested USB WiFi adapter: Netgear A9000.

# Requirements for 6 GHz operation:
# - WPA3 for authentication required (see Security section)
# - SAE key management required for WPA3 (see Security section)
# wpa_key_mgmt=SAE
# - Management Frame Protection required for WPA3 (see Security section)
# ieee80211w=2
# - Enables both H2E and HnP methods, eliminating authentication issues
#       caused by unsupported SAE methods on access point (AP)
# sae_pwe=2
# - WME/WMM required
# wme_enabled=1
# wmm_enabled=1
# - Operating Class required
# op_class=<see Operating Class section>


# Information:
# - tested on RasPi4B with 64 bit RasPiOS (based on Debian 13)
# - you need hostap 2.10 or later for WiFi 6/6e support: $ hostapd -v
# - you need hostap 2.11 or later for WiFi 7 support: $ hostapd -v
# - results for 6 GHz (6e) depend on your country and the wireless
#       regulations in your country
# - 6 GHz in EU countries works well for AP mode but in the US, 6 GHz
#      in AP mode is not available due to current wireless regulations
# - recommend that you use kernel 6.12 or later
# - suggested improvements to this document are welcome
