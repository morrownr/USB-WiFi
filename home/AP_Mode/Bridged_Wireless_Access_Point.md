## Bridged Wireless Access Point

A `Bridged Wireless Access Point` (aka Dumb AP) works within an existing
ethernet network to add WiFi capability where it does not exist or to
extend the network to WiFi capable computers and devices in areas where
the WiFi signal is weak or otherwise does not meet expectations. One big
advantage of this setup is that it can cost far less than many of the
Mesh kits that are available. Another advantage this setup has is that
the Raspberry Pi is a general purpose computer so it can be used for
additional tasks while performing as a `Bridged Wireless Access Point`.

```
                                                  ((((( tablet    
                                                 ╱
INTERNET >>>>>>> modem/router >>>>>>> RasPi ))))) ((((( laptop/desktop
                (cable)         ╱                ╲
                (fiber)       CAT 5e+             ((((( phone
                (dsl)         Powerline AV2        ╲
                (satellite)   Ethernet Over Coax    ((((( IoT
```

Note: The connection from the router to the RasPi is best served by a
CAT 5e or greater ethernet cable but alternatives exist. One
alternative is to use your existing electrical wiring by using
`Powerline AV2` adapters. These adapters are also called `Homeplug AV2`
adapters and come in a variety of speeds and prices. I have had success
with `Powerline AV2` adapters but success depends on the quality and setup
of the electrical wiring to be used.  Another option is `Ethernet Over
Coax (MoCa)`. Anyone considering `Powerline AV2` or `Ethernet Over
Coax (MoCa)` should research the products and be prepared to return
the products if expectations are not met.

Note: If you are looking to set up a Routed Wireless Access Point, my
recommendation is to use OpenWRT.

#### Single Band or Dual Band - Your Choice 

This document outlines single band and dual band WiFi setups using a
Raspberry Pi 4B with AC600 USB2 and AC1200 USB3 WiFi adapters for 5 GHz
band and either an additional external USB WiFi adapter or internal WiFi
for 2.4 GHz band. There is a lot of flexibility and capability available
with this type of setup.

Inportant: USB WiFi adapters contain only one internal radio. For a dual
band setup, you need two usb wifi adapters or one usb wifi adapter and
the RasPi internal wifi active.

Note: Tri Band works also. I will update this guide when I have a WiFi 6e
USB adapter and the time.

#### Information

This setup supports WPA3-SAE. It is disabled by default.

WPA3-SAE will not work with some Realtek 88xx drivers. Let's just say
that this issue is in progress.

WPA3-SAE works with Mediatek 761Xu and 7921au chipset based USB WiFI
adapters and, as far as I can tell, with all usb wifi adapters that use
Linux in-kernel drivers and I have tested many.

Note: This guide uses `systemd-networkd` for network management. If your
Linux distro uses Network Manager or Netplan, they must be disabled.
Sections that explain how to do this are located near the end of this
document. Please go to and follow the appropriate section now, if
required, before continuing with this setup guide. If you are using the
Raspberry Pi OS, you may continue with this setup guide now as the
Raspberry Pi OS does not use Network Manager or Netplan.

#### Tested Setup

[Raspberry Pi 4B (4gb)](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/)

[Raspberry Pi OS (with Desktop) (64 bit)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/#raspberry-pi-os-64-bit) - Strongly recommend that you start with a fresh installation.

Ethernet cable or Powerline AV2 providing internet connectivity

[USB WiFi Adapter(s)](https://github.com/morrownr/USB-WiFi)

[Case](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07T2CPC2H)

[Right Angle USB Extender](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07S6B5X76)

[Power Supply](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C9VYLLK)

[SD Card](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Endurance-MicroSDXC-Adapter-security-dp-B09WB35BXS/dp/B09WB35BXS)

Note: I use the case upside down with little stick-on rubber feet. There
are several little things that work better with the case upside down and
no negatives that I can find.

Note: Very few Powered USB 3 Hubs will work well with Raspberry Pi hardware. The
problems seem to stem from multiple reasons:

- Backfeeding of current into the Raspberry Pi USB subsystem .
- Bugs in the USB3 hub chipset.

Another problem with the Raspberry Pi 4B USB subsystem is that it is designed
to supply a maximum of 1200 mA of power. It is very easy to exceed this limit.

Note: The rtl88XXxu chipset based USB3 WiFi adapters require from 504 mA of
power up to well over 800 mA of power depending on the adapter.

Let me repeat: The Raspberry Pi 3B, 3B+ and 4B USB subsystems are only able
to supply a total of 1200 mA of power total to be divided between all attached
devices.

Note: The Alfa AWUS036ACM adapter, a mt7612u based adapter, requests a maximum
of 400 mA from the USB subsystem during initialization. Testing with a meter
shows actual usage of 360 mA during heavy load and usage of 180 mA during
light loads. This is much lower power usage than most AC1200 class adapters
which makes this adapter a good choice for a Raspberry Pi based access points. 
Other mt7612u and mt7610u chipset based adapters also show low power usage.
Another adapter that is very good for use in this setup is the Alfa AWUS036ACHM
which is an AC600 class adapter that has very impressive range.

#### Setup Steps

USB WiFi adapter driver installation, if required, should be performed
and tested prior to continuing.

Note: For USB3 adapters based on the Realtek rtl8812au, rtl8812bu and
rtl8814au chipsets, the following module parameters may be needed for
best performance when the adapter is set to support 5 GHz band: (if
using a rtl8812bu based adapter with a Raspberry Pi 4B or 400, you may
need to limit USB mode to USB2 due to a bug, probably in the Raspberry
Pi OS, that causes dropped connections-- rtw_switch_usb_mode=2)

```
rtw_vht_enable=2 rtw_switch_usb_mode=1
```

Note: For USB2 adapters based on the Realtek rtl8811au and rtl8821cu
chipset, the following module parameters may be needed for best
performance when the adapter is set to support 5 GHz band:

```
rtw_vht_enable=2
```

Note: For USB3 adapters based on the Realtek rtl8812au, rtl8812bu and
rtl8814au chipsets, the following module parameters may be needed for
best performance when the adapter is set to support 2.4 GHz band:

```
rtw_vht_enable=1 rtw_switch_usb_mode=2
```

Note: For USB2 adapters based on the Realtek rtl8811au and rtl8821cu
chipset, the following module parameters may be needed for best
performance when the adapter is set to support 2.4 GHz band:

```
rtw_vht_enable=1
```

Note: For USB3 adapters based on Mediatek mt7612u chipsets, the
following module parameter may be needed for best performance:

```
disable_usb_sg=1
```

Note: Here is a quick way to set the `disable_usb_sg` paramter:

```
sudo -i
echo "options mt76_usb disable_usb_sg=1" > /etc/modprobe.d/mt76_usb.conf
exit
```

Note: More information is available at the following site:

https://github.com/morrownr/7612u

Note: For this access point setup to support WPA3-SAE in a dual band
setup, two USB WiFi adapters with Mediatek or Atheros chipsets are
required as the Realtek and internal Raspberry Pi WiFi drivers do not
support WPA3-SAE as of the date of this document.

The follow site provides links to adapters that support WPA3-SAE: [USB-WIFI](https://github.com/morrownr/USB-WiFi)

-----

Update, upgrade and clean up the operating system.
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade && sudo apt autoremove
```

Note: Upgrading the operating system is not mandatory for this
installation but since some users forget to upgrade their system on a
regular basis, maybe it is a good idea.

-----

Reduce overall power consumption.

Note: All items in this step are optional and some items are specific to the
Raspberry Pi 4B. If installing to a Raspberry Pi 3B or 3B+ or other Pi you will
need to use the appropriate settings for that hardward.

```
sudo nano /boot/config.txt
```

Change:

```
# turn off onboard audio if audio is not required
#dtparam=audio=on
```

Add:

```
# turn off Mainboard LEDs
dtoverlay=act-led

# disable Activity LED
dtparam=act_led_trigger=none
dtparam=act_led_activelow=off

# disable Power LED
dtparam=pwr_led_trigger=none
dtparam=pwr_led_activelow=off

# turn off Ethernet port LEDs
dtparam=eth_led0=4
dtparam=eth_led1=4

# turn off Bluetooth
dtoverlay=disable-bt

# turn off onboard WiFi
dtoverlay=disable-wifi
```

-----

Overclock the CPU a modest amount.

Note: This step is optional and is specific to the Raspberry Pi 4B.

```
sudo nano /boot/config.txt
```

Add:

```
# overclock CPU
# (may not be required on current versions of the RasPiOS with a RasPi4B)
over_voltage=1
arm_freq=1600
```

-----

Enable predictable network interface names

Note: While this step is optional, problems can arise without it on dual
band setups. Some Linux distros have this capability enabled by default
but not the Raspberry Pi OS.

```
sudo raspi-config
```

Select: Advanced options > A4 Network Interface Names > Yes

-----

Reboot system.

```
sudo reboot
```

-----

Determine name and state of the network interfaces.

```
ip a
```

You may need to additionally run the following commands in order to
determine which adapter, in a dual band setup, has which interface name.

```
iw list
```
```
iw dev
```

Note: If the interface names are not `eth0`, `wlan0` and `wlan1`,
then the interface names used in your system will have to replace
`eth0`, `wlan0` and `wlan1` for the remainder of this document.

-----

Install `hostapd` package. Website - [hostapd](https://w1.fi/hostapd/)

```
sudo apt install hostapd
```

-----

Enable the wireless access point service and set it to start when your
Raspberry Pi boots.

```
sudo systemctl unmask hostapd
```
```
sudo systemctl enable hostapd
```

-----

Note: The below steps include creating two hostapd configurations files
but only one is needed if using a single band setup.

Create hostapd configuration file for 5 GHz band.

```
sudo nano /etc/hostapd/hostapd-5g.conf
```

-----

Check Interfaces File.

The interfaces file is not required and should be empty of any network config.

sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces

If your file shows more than the standard top 5 lines like this

```
# interfaces(5) file used by ifup(8) and ifdown(8)
# Please note that this file is written to be used with dhcpcd
# For static IP, consult /etc/dhcpcd.conf and 'man dhcpcd.conf'
# Include files from /etc/network/interfaces.d:
source-directory /etc/network/interfaces.d
```

then make a copy of your file and remove any excess lines from the interfaces file.

To make a backup of your interfaces file first, use the command

```
sudo cp /etc/network/interfaces /etc/network/interfaces-backup
```

-----

Block the ethernet and wlan interfaces from being processed, and let dhcpcd
configure only br0 via DHCP.

```
sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf
```

Add the following line above the first `interface xxx` line, if any.

```
denyinterfaces eth0 wl*
```

Go to the end of the file and add the following line

```
interface br0
```

How to keep Network Manager from causing problems.

Option 1:

Tell Network Manager to ignore specific devices.

```
$ sudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf
```

add

```
[keyfile]
unmanaged-devices=interface-name:wlan0
```

Note: Remember to replace wlan0 with your interface name.

Option 2:

Disable NetworkManager.

Note: For systems not running the Gnome desktop, purging Network Manager
is the easiest solution.

```
sudo apt purge network-manager
```

Note: For systems running the Gnome desktop, use the following.

```
sudo systemctl stop NetworkManager.service
```
```
sudo systemctl disable NetworkManager.service
```
```
sudo systemctl stop NetworkManager-wait-online.service
```
```
sudo systemctl disable NetworkManager-wait-online.service
```
```
sudo systemctl stop NetworkManager-dispatcher.service
```
```
sudo systemctl disable NetworkManager-dispatcher.service
```
```
sudo systemctl stop network-manager.service
```
```
sudo systemctl disable network-manager.service
```
```
sudo reboot
```

-----

Disable MAC address randomization.

Note: Disabling MAC address randomization may be needed to get a stable link.

```
sudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf
```

add

```
[device]
wifi.scan-rand-mac-address=no
```

save file

```
sudo reboot
```

-----
